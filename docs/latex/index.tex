This webpage is for C\+S\+C\+I3081W individual project. The current version is Iteration 1.\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
The goal of this software project is to develop a rudimentary transit simulator in which simulations can be controlled via external configuration and be visualized within a graphics window. In the first iteration, we will limit the simulation to a single scenario involving campus transit via bus here at the University of Minnesota.\hypertarget{index_des}{}\doxysection{Design elements}\label{index_des}
On of the very important design fot this project is to separate the graphics from the simulator. This allows us programmers to implement the basic functionality at the beginning and then embed the graphic into the program.

In iteration 1, it is seperated from graphics so that we adopted non-\/graphics methods to visualize data. It is basically done by involving report functions for classes which giving feedback of current status of each object. It is also helpfu for verifying functional operation in testing.\hypertarget{index_subdes}{}\doxysubsection{Structure of domain elements}\label{index_subdes}
The project includes basic building blocks for a transit system including buses, passengers, stops and routes. They are corresponding to 4 classes. \hypertarget{index_pas}{}\doxysubsubsection{Passenger}\label{index_pas}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classPassenger}{Passenger}} has attributes of his name, waiting time including that at stop and on bus and the id of his destination stop. Functions in this class can change the status of passenger.\hypertarget{index_stop}{}\doxysubsubsection{Stop}\label{index_stop}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classStop}{Stop}} have its own id, list of passenger waiting at the stop, and its location information. Methods in this class enables to load passenger on bus when a bus arrives.\hypertarget{index_bus}{}\doxysubsubsection{Bus}\label{index_bus}
Each \mbox{\hyperlink{classBus}{Bus}} object having 2 routes indicating an entire circulatory route. It also has a list of passengers on the bus, its speed and capacity. When stops try to load passenger on the bus, the bus will check if it is doable by checking if the bus is full. Buses move and update it\textquotesingle{}s position based on the speed and distance to the next stop.\hypertarget{index_route}{}\doxysubsubsection{Route}\label{index_route}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classRoute}{Route}} is constructed by a list of stops. It keeps track on next stops of the bus and provides it with distance information.\hypertarget{index_subdes}{}\doxysubsection{Structure of domain elements}\label{index_subdes}
To simulate the transit system according to the realiistic situation, the project is also having components contributing to simulation. \hypertarget{index_pf}{}\doxysubsubsection{Passenger factory}\label{index_pf}
It is basically to randomly generate name for passengers \hypertarget{index_pg}{}\doxysubsubsection{Passenger generator}\label{index_pg}
Given the possibility of passengers showing at each stop, it is to generate passenger on stops \hypertarget{index_sim}{}\doxysubsubsection{Simulator}\label{index_sim}
It is basically imitating the transit system by creating instances of those classes and implement by logical process.
